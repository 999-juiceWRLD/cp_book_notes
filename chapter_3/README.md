# Sorting

**Sorting** is a fundamentla algorithm design problem. Many efficient algorithms use sorting as a subroutine, because it is often easier to process data if the elements are in a sorted order. There are many algorithms for sorting, however the efficient general sorting algorithms work in $O(n\log n)$ time.

## $O(n^2) Algorithms$

A famous $O(n^2)$ time sorting algorithm is **bubble sort**. Bubble sort consists of $n$ rounds. On each round, the algorithm iterates thorugh the lements of the array. Whenever two consecutive elements are found that are not in correct order, the algorithm swaps them.
