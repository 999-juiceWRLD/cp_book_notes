# Data Structures

A **data structure** is a way to store data in the memory of a computer. It is important to choose an appropriate data structure for a problem, because each data structure has it's own advantages and disadvantages.

This chapter introduces the most important data structures in the C++ standard library. It's important to use STL whenever possible since they will save a lot of time.
