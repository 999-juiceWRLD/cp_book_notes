# Greedy Algorithms

A **greedy algorithm** constructs a solution to the problem by always making a choice that looks the best at the moment. A greedy algorithm never takes back it's choices, but directly constructs the final solution.

A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.

However, in many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution.

## Coin Problem

Consider a problem where we are given a set of coins and our task is to form a sum of money $n$ using the coins. The values of the coins are `coins` $= { c_1, c_2, c_3, ..., c_k }$ and each coins can be used as many times as we want. What is the minimum number of coins needed?

## Greedy Algorithm

A simple greedy algorithm to the problem always selects the largest possible coin, until the required sum of money has been constructed.

## Scheduling Problem

Many schedulin problems can be solved using greedy algorithms. A classic problem is as follows: Given $n$ events with their starting and ending times, find a schedule that includes as many events as possible. It is not possible to attend an event partially. Consider the following events:

| event | starting time | ending time |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| A     | 1             | 3           |
| B     | 2             | 5           |
| C     | 3             | 9           |
| D     | 6             | 8           |

In this case, the maximum number of events can be attended is two â€” events $B$ and $D$, or $A$ and $D$.

## Tasks and Deadlines

Now consider a new problem where we are given $n$ tasks with durations and deadlines and our task is to choose and order to perform the tasks. For each task, we earn $d - x$ points where $d$ is the task's deadline and $x$ is the moment when we finish the task. What is the largest possible total score we can obtain?

Suppose the tasks as follows:

| task | duration | deadline |
|------|----------|----------|
| A    | 4        | 2        |
| B    | 3        | 5        |
| C    | 2        | 7        |
| D    | 4        | 5        |

In this case, the optimal solution for this problem is:

`C -> B -> A -> D`

$C$ yields $5$ points, $B$ yields $0$ points, $A$ yields $-7$ points and $D$ yields $-8$ points, so the total score is $-10$.
