# Book Notes of the Competitive Programmer's Handbook

As the title says. This repository will contain my notes, and the source code for many of the algorithms. I will go chapter by chapter and commit my notes â€” hopefully, this would be helpful for other developers who want to improve themselves.

I haven't provided the free PDF of the book, just in case don't let this repo get deleted. You can find it. Also, you should be comfortable with basic components of C++, and preferably with algorithms & data structures.

Chapters are:

1. Basic techniques

    - chapter 1: introduction
    - chapter 2: time complexity
    - chapter 3: sorting
    - chapter 4: data structures

to be continued
