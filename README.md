# Book Notes of the Competitive Programmer's Handbook

As the title says. This repository will contain my notes, and the source code for many of the algorithms. I will go chapter by chapter and commit my notes â€” hopefully, this would be helpful for other developers who want to improve themselves.

I haven't provided the free PDF of the book, just in case don't let this repo get deleted. You can find it. Also, you should be comfortable with basic components of C++, and preferably with algorithms & data structures.

**Additional Note:** This book is not a thorough introduction as preface says. It's more like a helper, which stands for you not to lost in algorithms universe. Just grasp a lightweight intuition the mentioned concepts. Also, the code given in the book is not type of the one which must be taken as a reference. So, having said that, just have a look on the notes and probably that's it.

Chapters are:

1. Basic techniques

    - chapter 1: introduction
    - chapter 2: time complexity
    - chapter 3: sorting
    - chapter 4: data structures
    - chapter 5: general search

to be continued
