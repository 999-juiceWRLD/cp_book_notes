This section discusses some important mathematical concepts and formulas that are needed later in the book.

## Sum formulas

Each sum of the form
$\sum_{x=1}^n x^k = 1^k + 2^k + 3^k + ... + n^k,$
where $k$ is a positive integer, has a closed-form formula that is a polynomial of degree $k + 1$. For example<sup>1</sup>,

$\sum_{x=1}^n x = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{(n(n+1))}{2}$

and

$\sum_{x=1}^n x^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2 = \frac{(n(n+1)(2n+1))}{6}.$

An **arithmetic progression** is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive numbers is constant. For example,

$ 3, 7, 11, 15$
